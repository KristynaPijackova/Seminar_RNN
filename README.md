# Neural Networks and Signals

Hi and welcome to this repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repo has so far two tutorials which may (or may not) help you get started with using neural networks with sequence data. 

You can either run the filled ones, or try and write your own code, as the templates has empty spaces for you to code in. Feel free to adjust them as you like ðŸ™‚

In the [Wiki](https://github.com/KristynaPijackova/Tutorials_NNs_and_signals/wiki) bookmark of this repo you can find additional info, like interesting blogpost explaining the RNNs and thing I find usefull in general.
